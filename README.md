The memory game, on a PIC16f88 microcontroller.
______

This is a clone of the memory game "Simon". It was developed in a short period of time as part of a college assignment. For these reasons, the comments are in spanish and the code is not very clean.

Loading the sequences on the EEPROM is not necessary. Its only purpose was to cover one of the assignment requirements. 
These sequences are not random either, and the only random factor is choosing which sequence to play.

Note: I would like to clean the code, redesign the PCB and add functionality, but these changees will have to wait until I have some spare time.

For any requests, doubts or comments you can contact me at jcjc.dev@gmail.com
