This is a clone of the memory game "Simon". It was developed a long time ago for a college assignment and in a short 
period of time, so don't expect any complex features or clean/optimized code.

Loading the sequences on the EEPROM is not necessary. Its only purpose was to cover one of the assignment requirements. 
These sequences are not random either, and the only random factor is choosing which sequence to play.

For any requests or doubts you can contact me: jcjc.dev@gmail.com

Best,
